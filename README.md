The Stanford Data Project Analysis - Nashville, TN
On a typical day in the United States, police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops. Our team is gathering, analyzing, and releasing records from millions of traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the country. Our goal is to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.

1. Purpose-of-Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is kind of hollistic approach to explore what we can get out of the data, so I am not sure if there is a specific purpose or question. I will insert all the questions that come to my mind below and will update this notebook frequently. So there are couple of questions we are trying to answer here:

1.1. Is being arrested a gender dependeant?
1.2 Is being arrested a race dependeant?
1.3 How the race distribution looks like across the city?
1.4. Is the weather a playing factor of increasing/decreasing the tickets rates?
1.5 how the spatial distribution of the tickets looks like?
1.6 How the spatial distribution of the tickets and gender looks like?
1.7 Do girls make violations at a specific time of the day?
1.8 How the type of violation is distributed around the city?
1.9 Are there any places in the city where speeding is the most common violation?
1.10 What is the most important factor that predicts whether someone will be arrested or not
1.11 Is there a specific time in the day where the crime maxes out?
1.12 What is crime distriution on the age brackets..
